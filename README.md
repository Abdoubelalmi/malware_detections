- Utilizes a knowledge-based approach to detect malware based on activated behavioral patterns.
- Supports detection of various types of malware, including ransomware, bootkits, and more.
- Provides detailed information about detected malware and recommended actions.

## Technologies Used

- Django: Python-based web framework for backend development.
- JavaScript: Used for frontend interactivity and user interface enhancements.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and designing web pages.
- AIMA: Python library for artificial intelligence and knowledge representation.
